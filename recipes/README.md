Recipe idea:
- [ ] APIs for nutritional info and recipes  


- [ ] Make purchasing products as convenient as possible
    - [ ] Find Cheapest Prices:
            - [ ] Web-scrape 5(?) biggest supermarkets.
            - [ ] Find stores closest to user (?)
            - [ ] compile options e.g. cheapest store or cheapest total (but from different stores). 


- [ ] Help plan weekly meals dynamically 
    - [ ] ‘forgiving’ system
    - [ ] Replan rest of the meals in the week to meet requirements
        [ ] nutritional requirements
        [ ] budget requirements
    - [ ]  encourages participation
    - [ ] Replan future meals if weekly/monthly targets are not met
    - [ ] ‘Gamify’ (?). 


- [ ] Recommend options users want to eat
   [ ] Recipes from local restaurants (but modified to fit requirements)
   [ ] Natural Language Processing (? :OOO). 
   
   
- [ ] Make it easy for people to use the platform
    [ ] Low maintenance - don’t need to check often (maybe once a day to fill in details and check next day)
    [ ] Send reminders before people forget.  
    
    
- [ ] Money Maker ????
    [ ] Subscription Model???? ://///
    [ ] Promotions from local restaurants/stores/brands to promote certain products (inline with requirements)
